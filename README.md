# Final Project (SWDV-630)

My final project for SWDV-630 is a variation of a blogging system. This application allows freelance writers/editors to post and edit articles. The roles within this system are as follows: 
* Writer
* Editor
* Reader/Subscriber
* Administrator

### Writer

The writers role is to write the articles. Once the article is written it can then be submitted for review/editing. Once the article is submitted, it is then placed into a pool of articles to selected for editing by the editor. 

### Editor
The editors role is to proofread and edit the submitted articles. Once the article has been reviewed and edited, it is then submitted and placed into a pool of edited articles to be approved for publishing. 

### Administrator
The administrator's role is to approve articles for publishing. They are also responsible for approving the creation of writer and editor accounts.

### Reader/Subscriber
The reader/subscriber pays for a monthly or yearly subscription to the platform. They are able to read articles.
